# Doors
A RPG game where you are tasked to reach the center of a dungeon but it appears you've been stuck in an infinite loop. Every room you go in to leads to another 3 doors. Behind each door is either an enemy, trap, or nothing at all (Maybe even exp for getting through safe)! 

The game started as a UI project I did for a Visual Basic course I took, and then became a CLI game as a final project for a super easy Java course. I am cleaning up and changing around the code. My ultimate goal would be to start converting everying into a C++ game, with a GUI again (preferably like an actual game using OpenGL).
